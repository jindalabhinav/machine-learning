- Approach for design
- Requirements gathering
- Entities
- Class Diagram

## Problem Statement

The Problem statement could be anything, like Design. When asked for Design, we have:

- Knowns
- Unknowns
  - Ask for more questions like an overview, or what is x?

## Requirement Gathering

This is what needs to be implemented, but that might not give the entire picture, so asking questions and gathering requirements becomes very important.

`Requirement Gathering = Asking Questions`

- Current scope
- Future scope
- Behaviour
